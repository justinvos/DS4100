# Data Science 4100 - Data Collection, Integration and Analysis
A repository of notes for Northeastern University's Data Science 4100 course.

**Data science** is the field of turning data into actionable information.

**Big Data** is the integration of large amounts of multiple types of structured and unstructured data into a single data set that can be analyzed to gain insight and new understanding of an industry and the human interactions and expectations.

The **characteristics of Big Data** are:
* Very large, distributed aggregations of loosely structured data - often incomplete.
* In excess of multiple petabytes of exabytes of data.
* Billions of records about people or transactions
* Flat schemas with few complex interrelationships
* Time series data containing time-stamped events
* Connections between data elements that must be probabilistically inferred through machine learning.

The **six V's of Big Data** are:
* Volume - Big Data implies enormous amounts of data.
* Variety - Data usually comes from a variety of sources and mediums.
* Velocity - The flow of data that needs to be stored and analyzed is continuous.
* Veracity - Inherent noise, biases, abnormalities and mistakes are present in virtually all data streams, veracious data is without a significant amount of this dirty data.
* Validity - Data usually needs to be converted into the correct format or medium for analysis.
* Volatility - This refers to the degree to which the data changes over time.
